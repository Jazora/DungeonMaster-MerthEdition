Dec 20 - 13:44: Dwarves will die if they dont say Heigh ho every 5 minutes.
<br />
Dec 20 - 13:44: You sould add like heven when you die you go there
<br />
Dec 20 - 13:45: Dragons should be able to make some kinda training post even if they need a unique material to make it
<br />
Dec 20 - 13:45: STD's should be added so like every time a unit breeds theres a 10% Chance it gets a STD <3 (STDs killed at a random time of there life)<br />
Dec 20 - 13:48: Resource pillars, every unit within 10 tiles gets a certain resource every few minutes, Item rarity depends on the amount of certain pillars<br />
Dec 20 - 14:05: Meerkats should be added.<br />
Dec 20 - 14:06: Add a ginger race? :D<br />
Dec 20 - 14:09: AHA Best idea right here = Add a Perm mute button for Test and Dontattck what every player can access except Test and Dontattck!<br />
Dec 20 - 14:10: Glass forged wepons and armor, chance of breaking against blugeoning, pircing and slashing damage doesnt do as much damage as it slides off<br />
Dec 20 - 14:10: You should make a russian race :O
<br />
Dec 20 - 14:10: Better yet add a Perm BAN! For test and dontattck which is the same as perm mute but they get banned instead eh eh???<br />
Dec 20 - 14:10: Milking machines which we can attach to Angel and fill containers with so we can gain 0.1 strength a drink. Also we can get her co ords at any time so we can catch and milk her<br />
Dec 20 - 14:11: Pikachu nuff said.
<br />
Dec 20 - 14:14: add forest elves that make ironwood armor/wepons and iron wood floors and walls that dont catch on fire<br />
Dec 20 - 14:14: Somtimes if you manage to stop braking a wall right as its supposed to be broken, the mole or towercap and items will still fall out.<br />
Dec 20 - 14:16: Dildo sword that automatically KOs female units when you attack it, and makes Angels produce double milk when you use it versus her.<br />
Dec 20 - 14:17: Ners should get his own personal dildo and get it glued into his ass. Aswell as some duct tape to tie him together permanently so he can never do anything again!<br />
Dec 20 - 14:18: The use of coins which clan members when making coin option a % tax rate depending on clan set max 25%, with a donate coins option so they they can donate coins.

While this may sound crappy idea and totaly is but with the currency form ingame clans can then use it to buy perks which will be costing a Upkeep which will then be deducted well however you want per reboot or well ingame year.

perks may be shitty things but will add some extra effort can buy all but upkeep raises too etc.<br />
Dec 20 - 14:19: New type of plague you can give by breeding enemy units called AIDS. <br />
Dec 20 - 14:19: The game should take a Seikon no Qwaser route with sons of god representing elements of the periodic table gaining power when they suck milk out of boobs. And Angel could have the most delicious and powerful milk. Thus making her the target of everyone's raping<br />
Dec 20 - 14:20: Also ingame currency used for something.<br />
Dec 20 - 14:21: Add it so Mute even affects OOC<br />
Dec 20 - 14:25: An option within I > Magic option> Repeat meditation which auto repeats meditating on units however it's 50% longer and requires more food and sleeping which it'll resume after sleeping on meditating.( to make mages alot easier for fags but will take l onger too xD)<br />
Dec 20 - 14:26: Stepping onto unholy turf should damage units with holy shield, and give 3x the heat damage it does now.<br />
Dec 20 - 15:04: Allow Lizardmen to place down Swamp Turf
<br />
Dec 20 - 15:29: Make it so dragons can eat gold coins to increse their defence<br />
Dec 20 - 17:08: When you have a sword and a hellforged sword or a dagger and a hellforged dagger etc... if you try to drop or equip/unequip one it normally drops the normal dagger instead of the hellforged one.
<br />
Dec 20 - 18:13: Metal neckguard makes  a metal bow instead.<br />
Dec 20 - 22:06: Make it so that "immuned" status returns the target to the stomach fullness and tiredness they had before it was used, instead of just resting them without sleeping.<br />
Dec 20 - 23:24: Ignore doesn't work. I muted Test2934 and ignored him, and he was able to keep spamming at me. I appeared offline and he was STILL able to message me. Look into it Sscralster?<br />
Dec 21 - 03:40: Adamant Bucklers on the floor are invisible, and sometimes (even though the crafting succeeds) fail to appear at all. Theevilm3 crafted 4, three I couldn't find and one I only got by using pick-up-equipment.<br />
Dec 21 - 12:35: Suggesting a delay that all permanent Illithid rares be removed because it is too easy to spam remake and fuck with people. When the brain dies you lose it for the round.<br />
Dec 21 - 16:23: Sand people can not skin moles even if next to a camp fire.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:32: Juggling as a skill, it allows you to carry more weight by throwing the items above your characters head and catching them again, but it is risky since while its being juggled somone can steal it.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:39: Stamina/Running level the more you run the better it is and it allows you to go faster or longer depending on what Sscral thinks is better and wouldnt be gamebreaking.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:40: An option to poison rocks so if a gargoyle eats it, they can say bye bye.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:44: Penguins in the snow climate.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:44: A powerlevel skill that increases as your character's overall combat stats increase. Once it reaches past 9000, you get a prize.<br />
Dec 22 - 09:54: Add unarmed fighting styles to the game.
<br />
Dec 22 - 12:59: Perhaps dragons should be able to lay magic eggs randomly at a 1-2% chance. Dragon mages would get many of the normal mage spells but have higher mana pools, and perhaps special dragon only spells. <br />
Dec 22 - 19:42: People being able to marry eachothers units so instead of having a king and queen from one player be able to have a queen and a king of the same marriage belonging to different players.
<br />
Dec 22 - 22:35: Spiders shouldn't gain poison until level 10, and poison damage should increase with level and less with age.<br />
Dec 23 - 13:08: If you boot yourself from a clan and then get invited to somone elses can you can kick and invite people freely from that clan. Even if you are not the owner of it.<br />
Dec 25 - 09:33: {Test2934} Soldier 6 violently bashes {Dontattck}'s Demon's Demon in the skull smashing their helmet!

Dec 25 - 17:36: give svars a potion skill of 20
<br />
Dec 28 - 20:54: re add supernatral bonecrafting to kolbolds<br />
Dec 28 - 22:04: Spiders lay eggs into captured units ad release them, eggs hatch later<br />
Jan 02 - 03:51: This is not a bug report, but a suggestion.. please dont murder me since theres no suggest verb XD. I suggest you should give bat some specific race, since they can't level up or gain carry weight. If you do give them stat gains, dont forget to make them being able to be hungry or tired, since both stats stay at 100. Also, wondering if you gave bats skin/meat yet. You dont have to put this in the game,  I just want to make bats more useful since they can only train claw skill. <br />
Jan 02 - 03:55: Not sure if this is a bug/glitch..but dragons get call bat. Was this on purpose?<br />
Jan 03 - 17:38: Set CoolDown to 0 upon loading<br />
Jan 07 - 23:56: Make trees give EXP when cut
<br />
Jan 08 - 00:15: You should add nether silk. Like normal silk, capes and robes and other things can be made, but they're much better. Similar to demonleather and leather, but they come from nether manifestations.<br />
Jan 08 - 00:19: Fix silver armor, werewolves and vampires can wear/pick them up. Add cure lycantrophy so you can cure werewolf just like curing vampirism<br />
Jan 08 - 00:20: also fix silver weapons.. forgot to add this<br />
Jan 08 - 00:33: Dragons need a stat panel to show their steps taken towards becoming a certain type of dragon
<br />
Jan 08 - 00:33: Give dragons a stat panel so you know how many steps you've taken to become whatever type of dragon.<br />
Jan 08 - 01:15: Add drop leather..<br />
Jan 08 - 02:29: Add the ability to make jungle in willful alteration.<br />
Jan 08 - 14:12: Fix corpse devouring for werewolves<br />
Jan 10 - 05:47: Add "Jungle" on willful alteration.. you can make all tiles except jungle, this needs to be fixed D:<br />
Jan 10 - 06:21: Add drop all skin<br />
Jan 10 - 06:36: Downstairs is bugged.. once you climb up a downstairs, u can't climb back
<br />
Jan 10 - 14:08: Give nether manifestations mana
<br />
Jan 10 - 18:57: Make the "mad one" equipment look less gay<br />
Jan 11 - 02:45: Should make craft gems like Ingots, if you craft diamonds it should do all diamonds (or watever gem your messing with) in your inventory at once

<br />
Jan 11 - 03:00: more of a suggestion.... new weapon ......Throwing Knives<br />
Jan 11 - 07:01: {ThunderBane} Nether Manifestation goes insane from the horror and tears their own eyes out!......they kinda come from hell..... <br />
Jan 12 - 13:57: DrakeEX reported: Water made by water dragons, destructive alteration, and maybe other things cannot be interacted with to fill buckets. Flasks work on them, but not buckets.<br />
